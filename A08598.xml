            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT may be thought great boldnes in mee (right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable &amp; right Worſhipfull) beeing one altogether vnknown to you, that I ſhould thus preſume to ſeeke the patronizing of theſe my poore endeuours, vnder the protection of your Honorable and Worſhipfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunces, and ſo in ſome ſort I doe my ſelfe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.

            <p>SInce it hath beene obſerued as a cuſtome (curteous Reader) in all times heeretofore, that in the publication of bookes, ſome method or other of the VVriters meaning, ſhould be expreſſed for the Readers better vnderſtanding: I, being bound (as it were) to that ceremony, though no way diſtruſtfull of thy kind opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and iudgement, firſt, wiſhing thy health and happineſſe in Chriſt, and next intreating thy chriſtianlike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of mee and this preſent la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, pray thee to take notice of theſe few lines following.</p>
            <p>Theſe gathered places out of the moſt ſacred Scriptures, marſhalled in the beſt manner that I could deuiſe, concerning thoſe nine neceſſarie poynts, which in the page next after this Epiſtle are more at large expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
<pb facs="tcp:24767:5"/> likewiſe the graue &amp; religious Sentences of the Doctors &amp; Fathers, as alſo the ſweete ſayings of ſundr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Philoſophers: Though they haue coſt me more paines then here I will expreſſe, &amp; haue proued to my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as I pray they may to thine, yet if thy freendly acceptance aunſwere but my good meaning, &amp; ouer-raſh reading deliuer not as rude cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, I doubt not but our benefite hereby will proue both alike; and all redound to his honour, in whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence it was vndertaken.</p>
            <p>If thou demaund a reaſon, why I entitle it by the name of <hi>The Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of holy Scriptures,</hi> my aunſwere is, that all the ſentences heerein ſette downe, both in ſounde, ſence, and ſweetnes, doe ſauour of a muſicall imitation, and concord together af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the nature of a diuine harmonie, as from the beginning to the end of each ſection thou maiſt eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.
<pb facs="tcp:24767:5"/> Secondly, as in Muſique, be there neuer ſo many parts, yet all muſt agree &amp; make a perfect Vniſon: euen ſo do theſe aunſwere to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other as in report, all tending to one effect and purpoſe, and all at full ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing the argument handled. Firſt the Scriptures being the ground and plaine-ſong, the Doctors following thereon in ſweet diuine deſcant, and the Philoſophers bearing a by part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong to make vp the melodie, and all in one ſound, ſing to Gods glory.</p>
            <p>As for the Heathen authorities heerein alleaged, albeit they expreſſe not onely ſinguler wiſedome, but likewiſe ſauour of a very deuoute (though ignorant) zeale: they are not inſerted with any intent in mee, that by them ſhould be prooued the very leaſt principle of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; but rather to declare, howe neere ſuch men as came ſhort of any right knowledge of God, yet by the
<pb facs="tcp:24767:6"/> bare light of Nature onely, aymed at the truth; and made a kinde of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious vſe to themſelues, of a further deſire to know that truth.</p>
            <p>If in the firſt poynt handled, it ſhall be obiected, that I haue not ſo iuſtly obſerued the order of an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, as in the other following, by vſing needles wordes of the Fathers, as ſaith ſuch a one, and ſuch a one: I did the more willingly ſlip from my courſe in that caſe, becauſe the words are none of mine owne, and I could not (in my conceit) giue right enough to them that owed them, or ſufficiently deliuer, howe ſoundlie their ſentences approued euery allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged place.</p>
            <p>Now, if any nice eare, (whom no note can pleaſe, &amp; to whom the very beſt muſique ſeemeth vnpleaſant,) ſhall in this flowing age of right skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Maiſters in Gods muſicke, whoſe number (for his Names ſake) may
<pb facs="tcp:24767:6"/> hee more and more increaſe; if ſuch a one I ſay, doe obiect what I freelie confeſſe, that here wanteth ſuch arte &amp; ſchollarſhip, as ſuch a ſerious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect worthily deſerued: let me thus aunſwere for my ſelfe; As there be maiſter workmen in Gods buildings, ſo there muſt be ſome to cary ſtones, lime and morter, of which place nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther though I account my ſelfe any way worthy, yet let not the pooreſt labourers paines in ſuch a ſeruice be deſpiſed. I did it diuers yeeres ſince for my owne inſtruction, &amp; thought to haue kept it onely for my priuate comfort, till others thinking better thereof then I my ſelfe can, woulde needes preuaile with mee to haue it publiſhed: which ſince I coulde not well denie, let this ſerue for all obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whatſoeuer. The reuerend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Gods Name, in me both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and finiſhed the work, deſire to benefite others as ſimple as my ſelfe,
<pb facs="tcp:24767:7"/> was the cheefe marke I aymed at, &amp; the hope I haue that ſome good may enſue heereof, is the onely recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence I requeſt for my paines.

                     <p>And, not much vnlike to this ſaying of Salomon, is the confeſſion of Eſdras vnto the Angell, which was ſent to inſtruct him, where hee ſaith; I knovve (Lord) that the<note place="margin">2, Eſdr. 7. 62 63, 64. &amp;c.</note> moſt High is called mercifull, in that hee

                     <p>But the Lord God called vnto him, and ſaid: Ionas, dooſt thou well to be angrie?

                     <p>The third is, that as hee is Iudge, ſo hee will deale rightly in iudgement with all men, and revvarde euery one at his death, according to the workes which hee hath doone in this life.</p>

                     <p>The wayes of the Lorde our God, (as S.<note place="margin">Augustine.</note> Auguſtine ſaith,) are to bee taken for all manner of his dooings: and how ſoeuer it pleaſeth him at any time to remoue things, firſt to one ſide, then to another, yet his wayes therein are alwaies righteous, and he beſt knoweth wherefore he doth ſo.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, It is not to be doubted (ſaith he) that God doth well: yea, when ſoeuer hee ſuffereth to be done, whatſoeuer things are euill done; for, hee doth not ſuffer this, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then by iuſt iudgement: and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, all that is iuſt is good. Although there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe things that be euill, inaſmuch as they bee euill, be not good, yet it is good,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:24767:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> that there ſhould be things not onelie that are good, but alſo that are euill. For, except it were good, that there ſhould bee thinges that are euill, the Almightie goodneſſe woulde by no meanes ſuffer them to bee. For, it is (no doubt) as eaſie a thing to him, not to ſuffer that thing to be, which hee woulde ſhoulde not be, as it is to doe that, which he is willing to doe.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, whatſoeuer happeneth heere at any time againſt our wills, wee ought to vnderſtande, that it hapneth not but by the will of God, by his prouidence, by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, by his commaundement, and by his Law. And, although wee know not, vvhy and wherfore it is done; yet we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, it is done according to his wiſedome that gouerneth all things, and that it is not done without ſome ſpeciall cauſe.</p>
                     <p>For, the Lord our God, is righteous (as<note place="margin">Pſal, 145. 17</note> the Pſalmiſt ſaith) in all his vvayes, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in all his workes.</p>
                     <p>Yea; his vvayes are righteous; &amp; the iuſt<note place="margin">Hoſe, 14, 10</note> ſhal walke in them, but the wicked ſhall fall therein.</p>
                     <p>For, as his wayes are plaine and right vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">Ecclꝰ, 39, 24</note> the iuſt ſo are they ſtumbling blocks vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wicked.</p>

                     <p>Alſo; We ſay truly, in affirming, that the<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> firſt man onely could fulfill that he would, when as yet his free-vvill of choyſe vvas ſound, and whole, before the fault.</p>
                     <p>But man miſvſing his free-will, loſt both<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> himſelfe, and his will.</p>
                     <p>The firſt man, vvas created in nature,<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> without blame in nature: without fault, he was created vpright: he did not make him ſelfe vpright: It is knowne what hee made himſelfe; falling out of the hande of the Potter, he was broken. For, hee that made him, did gouerne him, but hee was willing to forſake him that made him, and God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him ſo to doe, as it were, ſaying thus: Let him forſake me, that he may find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and that he may by his miſery proue, that without mee, he can doe nothing. By this meane therefore, would God ſhew vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man, what free-will is able to doe vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God.</p>
                     <p>Free-vvill before the fall of Adam, vvas<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> an vpright free-will: before which, fire and water was layde of God, and the firſt man did reach his hand vnto which hee would: hee did chooſe fire, &amp; forſooke vvater. See

                     <p>We had free-will before ſinne, to worke<note place="margin">Chriſostome.</note> well, but after ſinne we had none; becauſe we were not able by our owne power and ſtrength, after ſinne, to eſcape from the power of the deuill.

                     <p>There is a ſentence in Salomons Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbs, where the Wiſeman thus ſpeaketh, ſaying; * The preparations of the hart, are<note place="margin">Prou, 16, 1,</note> in man: but the aunſwere of the tongue, is of the Lord.</p>

                     <p>According alſo to the former part of the Apoſtles ſpeech in the afore-ſaide chapter, (concerning the comming of Chriſt to iudgement; with the reſurrection of mens bodies, and the immortality of the ſoule,) ſpeaketh holy Iob, in the 19. of his booke, with a confident and perfect hope thereof, ſaying: * I am ſure that my Redeemer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,<note place="margin">Iob, 19, 25, 26, 27,</note> and that he ſhall ſtand the laſt on the earth. And though after my skin, wormes deſtroy this bodie, yet ſhall I ſee GOD in my fleſh: whom I my ſelfe ſhall ſee, and

                     <p>Satisfaction, beeing the third &amp; laſt part<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> of repentance, is; cheefely to cutte off the cauſes of ſuch ſinnes, as in former time we haue loued; &amp; not to cherriſh henceforth by ſuggeſtions, any entrance into them.</p>
                     <p>For, wee doe not truly ſatiſ-fie, although<note place="margin">Gregory.</note> wee ceaſe from iniquitie; vnleſſe wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute by oppoſite bewailings, the euils which heere-to-fore wee haue moſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; &amp; endeuour with all our might, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to with-ſtand all ſuch kind of pleaſures, as prouoke men to ſin and wickednes.</p>
                     <p>Wee ought alſo to vnderſtand, that in<note place="margin">Phil. Mel.</note> the worke of true repentance, ſatiſ-faction is to be made three ſeuerall waies. Firſt, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: to wit, when through faith and confidence, wee humbly preſent our ſelues

                     <p>Secondly, ſatiſ-faction is to be made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, after Excommunication, for ſuch offences as we haue done: teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby, both in the ſight of God and man, our humble ſubmiſſion and vnfained repentance.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, ſatisfaction ought to be made vnto our neighbour or brother, if we haue any way wronged him, either in vvord or deede: namely thus; hee muſt be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed by confeſſing the fault vnto him: and reſtitution muſt likewiſe be made, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the damage we haue done him: otherwiſe, our repentance is greatly to bee ſuſpected of hipocriſie, if (beeing able) we make not recompence by reſtitution.</p>
                     <p>Againe; in making ſatiſ-faction, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,<note place="margin">Chriſostome.</note> ought to be equall to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent offence; and thou oughteſt to bee as ready to lament, as thou waſt to offend.

                     <p>As may for example more plainelie be perceiued, by reading the different doings of theſe two men following. Baltazar the king of Babel, (as Daniell affirmeth,) euen in the time of his banquetting amongſt his<note place="margin">Dan. 5. 5. 6.</note> thouſand Princes, perfectly diſcerned the hande of a man, writing vppon the plaiſter of his wall, and was greatly (for the time) terrified thereby; inſomuch, that the verie ioynts of his loynes were looſed, his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce changed, his thoughts troubled, and his knees ſmote one againſt the other
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:24767:138"/> for feare of Gods iudgements.

                     <p>Contrariwiſe; by Samuell it is affirmed: that king Dauid did not only ſee the foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his offence, wherein too long hee had (in a manner) ſenceleſly liued, ſo ſoone as the ſhril-ſounding voyce of Nathan, had once (by denouncing Gods anger) tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly<note place="margin">2, Sam. 12. chap.</note> awaked him out of his deadly ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: but alſo preſently fore-ſaw, by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ſpeech of the Prophet, &amp; ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie preuented, by his vnfained repentance and amendement, the heauy wrath of the Almighty; which otherwiſe was likely for his iniquitie, to fall vpon him.</p>
                     <p>Marke therefore, what counſell Sirach giueth to this purpoſe, and endeuour dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to follow the ſame, where he ſayth:

                     <p>Make much [alſo] of time; and eſchew<note place="margin">Ecclus, 4, 20</note> the thing that is euill.</p>
                     <p>Remember that death tarrieth not, and<note place="margin">Ecclꝰ, 14, 12</note> that the couenaunt of the graue is not ſhewed vnto thee.</p>

                     <p>Neither is there any more place or time<note place="margin">Cyprian.</note> of repentance left for any man, after hee is once departed out of this vvorlde: life is heere either loſt or wonne: euerlaſting ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is onely heere prouided for, by the due worſhipping of God, and the fruites of fayth.</p>
